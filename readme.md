## General Workbooks
* 0.1-lightkurve-nb - general LightKurve playground
* 0.2-workbook - a scratch pad
* 0.3-lightcurves - Notebook to explore light curve I/O
* 0.3.1-lightcurves-example - A curated example notebook for using lightkurve
* 0.4_Bokeh_viz - A GUI visualization tool to examine clustering and light curves
## Workbooks for Median Absolute Deviation Work 
* 1.0-mad-threshold-plots - Notebook to make MAD plots from previously generated tables
## Workbooks for anomaly identification
* 2.0-anomalies-1camtest - Sector 9 Camera 1 TMC targets anomaly detection test
* 2.1-anomalies-allcamtest - Sector 9 All Cameras TMC targets anomaly detection test
## Workbooks to examine effects of weighting cadences by their MAD by sector/camera
* 3.0-weighting - linear weighting
* 3.1-weighting - logarithmic weighting
* 3.2-nopweighting - without any weighting
* 3.3-weighting-comp - workbook to compare the different schemes
## Sector 9 Workbooks
* 4.0-sector9 - Feature calc and anomaly scoring for Sector 9
* 4.1-sector9 - Secondary analysis, clustering, comparing known variables
## Identifying missing light curves in our bucket
* 5.0-missing-lcs - notebook to find missing lcs. Looks by sector, finds all TIC IDs in area near existing data, identifies which aren't in existing data, then uses tess-point to verify whether they actually fall on camera or not.
